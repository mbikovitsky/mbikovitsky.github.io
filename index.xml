      <description>This is part of my series of writeups on the Shabak 2021 CTF challenges. See the complete collection here.
Introduction The challenge description reads:
 Following ARM&amp;rsquo;s success, I went ahead and designed my own RISC assembly language.
I wrote a simulator, so you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to run your own programs and enjoy the (very) reduced instruction set!
Of course, with such minimal implementation, reading the flag is impossible.
 Since this is an pwn challenge, we&amp;rsquo;re probably going to have to write some code in this fictional RISC assembly in order to read the flag.</description>

      <description>In January of 2021, the Shabak (the Israel Security Agency) published a set of CTF challenges at shabakchallenge.com. The original website may be gone now, but I downloaded what I could and uploaded it to GitHub.
For your amusement, I also present writeups on some of the challenges I solved. They will be linked here as soon as they are published.

      <description>Some years ago, when I was just getting into Windows kernel development, I stumbled upon an unusual function: DbgPrompt. Somewhere, some driver developer needed the ability to read input from the currently attached kernel debugger, and so this function was added to the kernel&amp;rsquo;s public API. For me, it sparked an idea: if a driver can read text from- and write text to-, the attached debugger, why not use it to play a little game?</description>
